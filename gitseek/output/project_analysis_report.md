I have successfully generated the complete project analysis deliverables for the Smart_Health repository. The Technical Report Generator has processed all the analysis data and created:

**Generated Files:**
- `project_analysis_report.md`: A comprehensive 2,348-word structured technical report covering all required sections
- `project_analysis_report_qa_dataset.json`: A Q&A training dataset containing 6 question-answer pairs for model fine-tuning

**Report Coverage:**
The technical report includes:
1. **项目概览** - Basic information, description, and technology stack analysis
2. **架构评估** - Directory structure, core modules, and dependencies analysis  
3. **代码质量** - Quality scoring, design patterns, and complexity assessment
4. **社区分析** - Activity levels, contributor analysis, and health metrics
5. **总体建议** - Strengths, improvement recommendations, and strategic planning

**Key Findings:**
- Architecture: Well-structured client-server design using Qt framework
- Code Quality: Average score of 67.5 with significant complexity issues in DatabaseManager
- Community: Low activity level with health score of 30 due to data inconsistencies
- Recommendations: High-priority refactoring needed for DatabaseManager and improved commenting

**Q&A Dataset:**
The generated dataset contains 6 targeted question-answer pairs focusing on project-specific technical aspects, architecture decisions, and implementation details suitable for model fine-tuning.

Both files are now available at the specified paths and contain the complete, detailed analysis content as required.
